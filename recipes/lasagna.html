            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li><h4>Step 2</h4>
                        Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li><h4>Step 3</h4>
                    Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
                <li><h4>Step 4</h4>
                    Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
                <li><h4>Step 5</h4>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
